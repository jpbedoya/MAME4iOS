///
/// a subclass of UISegmentedControl that only shows the currently selected item, and lets the user change
/// the currently selected item in a popup window on iOS. on tvOS the SegmentedControl will grow/shrink
///
/// - the main use for this controll is in a UIBarButtonItem in a UINavigationBar or a UIToolBar
///
/// - if you pass UISegmentedControlNoSegment as the index to setImage/Title:forSegmentAtIndex: you can
///  change the item that is displayed instead of the currently selected item.
///
/// - by default PopupSegmentedControl will display a Horizontal popup, unless the items are wider than 50% of the screen,
///  You can force a Vertical popup always by setting UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight
///
/// - changing the list of items after init is currently not supported.
